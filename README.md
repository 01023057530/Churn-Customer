# NEURONETIX Abdelghafor's Hackaton ML Engineer Project
# Churn_Customer

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior in the telecom industry to predict 
churn and identify meaningful customer segments. Using classical machine learning 
techniques, the goal is to build predictive models that classify customers into churn or 
non-churn categories and segment them into groups based on shared characteristics. 
This analysis will empower telecom businesses to improve customer retention and 
tailor services to different customer segments.
